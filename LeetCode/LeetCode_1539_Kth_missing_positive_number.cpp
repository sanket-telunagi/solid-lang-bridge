/*
    Given an array arr of positive integers sorted in a strictly increasing order, and an integer k.
    Return the kth positive integer that is missing from this array.

    Ex - 1
    Input: arr = [2,3,4,7,11], k = 5
    Output: 9
    Explanation: The missing positive integers are [1,5,6,8,9,10,12,13,...]. 
                 The 5th missing positive integer is 9.

    Ex - 2
    Input: arr = [1,2,3,4], k = 2
    Output: 6
    Explanation: The missing positive integers are [5,6,7,...]. 
                 The 2nd missing positive integer is 6.

    Constraints:

    1 <= arr.length <= 1000
    1 <= arr[i] <= 1000
    1 <= k <= 1000
    arr[i] < arr[j] for 1 <= i < j <= arr.length

    Could you solve this problem in less than O(n) complexity?
